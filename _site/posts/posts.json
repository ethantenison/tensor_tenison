We investigate this question across hundreds of transit projects from around the world. We have created a database that spans more than 50 countries and totals more than 11,000 km of urban rail built since the late 1990s. We will also examine this question in greater detail by carrying out six in-depth case studies that take a closer look at unique considerations and variables that aren’t easily quantified, like project management, governance, and site conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe goal of this work is to figure out how to deliver more high-capacity transit projects for a fraction of the cost in countries like the United States. Additionally, we hope that our site will be a useful resource for elected officials, planners, researchers, journalists, advocates, and others interested in contextualizing transit-infrastructure costs and fighting for better projects.\r\n\r\nOne of the reason why I chose it was because the city I live in, Austin, approved a massive expansion of its rail transit-system. From the beginning of the planning process (a different version was defeat once before), it was highly controversial partly because of the cost. Given the congestion on Austin’s roads already, it doesn’t seem like the city has any other viable option to alleviate the problem.\r\nDownloading the data\r\n\r\n\r\nlibrary(tidytuesdayR)# tidytuesday data package \r\nlibrary(tidyverse)   # compendium of data lifecycle packages\r\nlibrary(vip)         # for visualizing variable importance\r\nlibrary(dotwhisker)  # for visualizing regression \r\n\r\ntuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2021, week = 2)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Downloading file 1 of 1: `transit_cost.csv`\r\n\r\nSneak Peak\r\n\r\nRows: 544\r\nColumns: 20\r\n$ e                <dbl> 7136, 7137, 7138, 7139, 7144, 7145, 7146, 7~\r\n$ country          <chr> \"CA\", \"CA\", \"CA\", \"CA\", \"CA\", \"NL\", \"CA\", \"~\r\n$ city             <chr> \"Vancouver\", \"Toronto\", \"Toronto\", \"Toronto~\r\n$ line             <chr> \"Broadway\", \"Vaughan\", \"Scarborough\", \"Onta~\r\n$ start_year       <chr> \"2020\", \"2009\", \"2020\", \"2020\", \"2020\", \"20~\r\n$ end_year         <chr> \"2025\", \"2017\", \"2030\", \"2030\", \"2030\", \"20~\r\n$ rr               <dbl> 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0~\r\n$ length           <dbl> 5.7, 8.6, 7.8, 15.5, 7.4, 9.7, 5.8, 5.1, 4.~\r\n$ tunnel_per       <chr> \"87.72%\", \"100.00%\", \"100.00%\", \"57.00%\", \"~\r\n$ tunnel           <dbl> 5.0, 8.6, 7.8, 8.8, 7.4, 7.1, 5.8, 5.1, 4.2~\r\n$ stations         <dbl> 6, 6, 3, 15, 6, 8, 5, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 7, ~\r\n$ source1          <chr> \"Plan\", \"Media\", \"Wiki\", \"Plan\", \"Plan\", \"W~\r\n$ cost             <dbl> 2830, 3200, 5500, 8573, 5600, 3100, 4500, 1~\r\n$ currency         <chr> \"CAD\", \"CAD\", \"CAD\", \"CAD\", \"CAD\", \"EUR\", \"~\r\n$ year             <dbl> 2018, 2013, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2009, 2018, 2~\r\n$ ppp_rate         <dbl> 0.840, 0.810, 0.840, 0.840, 0.840, 1.300, 0~\r\n$ real_cost        <chr> \"2377.2\", \"2592\", \"4620\", \"7201.32\", \"4704\"~\r\n$ cost_km_millions <dbl> 417.05263, 301.39535, 592.30769, 464.60129,~\r\n$ source2          <chr> \"Media\", \"Media\", \"Media\", \"Plan\", \"Media\",~\r\n$ reference        <chr> \"https://www.translink.ca/Plans-and-Project~\r\n\r\nThe data set contains twenty variables including start and end date, track length, number of stations, whether it contains a tunnel, and cost recalculated using different measures.\r\nAverage cost per country\r\nAs mentioned below, the United States is by far the most expensive place to built transit systems. Hopefully we’ll be able to discover exactly why that is, but I have a feeling we’re missing some crucial variables.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTotal Lines per country\r\nAlthough I some transit lines are not accounted for in this data set, namely Austin’s red line, it is indisputable that China is the global leader in rail construction over the past 30 years. This partially because China started from an extremely low level of infrastructure and because of Chinese government intervention. Given that the Chinese construction and real estate industries are bordering on insolvency because of over investment, the same may be true for transit. That question we certainly can’t answer from this data set though!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is causing rail to be so expensive in the US?\r\nLet’s take a deeper look how the different variables are correlated with each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can glean from the matrix that both the number of stations and tunnel length were positively correlated with the real cost of the project. We can also see that whether a track is built on an existing railroad is positively correlated with length in years of the project.\r\nLinear Regression\r\nUnfortunately, with the current variables available, we can not make accurate predictions on cost per km, but with real cost as the dependent variable we get some good explanatory power.\r\n\r\n\r\nCall:\r\nstats::lm(formula = real_cost ~ ., data = data)\r\n\r\nResiduals:\r\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \r\n-9813.8 -1164.3  -302.1   590.8 17242.8 \r\n\r\nCoefficients:\r\n              Estimate Std.

That’s a no-brainer. The variables are significant, and our R^2 is close to 70%. Now let’s see if our model accurately predicts the real cost .\r\nPrediction\r\nData splitting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 110 x 1\r\n   .pred\r\n   <dbl>\r\n 1 1586.\r\n 2 3068.\r\n 3  777.\r\n 4  359.\r\n 5 1489.\r\n 6 3136.\r\n 7 1429.\r\n 8  902.\r\n 9 1333.\r\n10 1559.\r\n# ... with 100 more rows\r\n\r\nEvaluating\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on the diagnostic tests, there seem to ve several points that are biasing our results. This affects the interpretability and predictive power of our model.\r\nVariable Importance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main take away from the variable importance plot is that the length of the track has a huge influence on the track (no brainer), and that tunnels have an even bigger impact (also a no brainer perhaps).\r\nCheck for accuracy\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 1 x 3\r\n  .metric .estimator .estimate\r\n  <chr>   <chr>          <dbl>\r\n1 rmse    standard       2673.\r\n\r\n\r\nMirroring the diagnostic tests, the model is better when not considering the outliers. Let’s try a different model to improve accuracy.\r\nRandom Forest\r\n\r\nRandom Forest Model Specification (regression)\r\n\r\nComputational engine: ranger \r\nparsnip model object\r\n\r\nFit time:  250ms \r\nRanger result\r\n\r\nCall:\r\n ranger::ranger(x = maybe_data_frame(x), y = y, num.threads = 1,      verbose = FALSE, seed = sample.int(10^5, 1)) \r\n\r\nType:                             Regression \r\nNumber of trees:                  500 \r\nSample size:                      328 \r\nNumber of independent variables:  6 \r\nMtry:                             2 \r\nTarget node size:                 5 \r\nVariable importance mode:         none \r\nSplitrule:                        variance \r\nOOB prediction error (MSE):       10487881 \r\nR squared (OOB):                  0.5995448 \r\n# A tibble: 1 x 3\r\n  .metric .estimator .estimate\r\n  <chr>   <chr>          <dbl>\r\n1 rmse    standard       2649.\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on the results, both of them are particularly good. Accordingly, our data set lacks certain variables that might impact the overal cost of a metro rail project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
