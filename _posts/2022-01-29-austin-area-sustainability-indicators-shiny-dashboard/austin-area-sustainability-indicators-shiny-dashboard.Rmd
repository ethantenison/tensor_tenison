# Background 

<br>

The [Austin Area Sustainability Indicators]("http://www.austinindicators.org/") project (A2SI), is an initiative at the University of Texas at Austin, aims is to measure the quality of life, sustainability trends, and serve as the foundation to address challenges in Central Texas. Indicators describe context, identify trends, and translate data into points that are easier to communicate. These indicators span air quality, population demographics, health, mobility, economy, and the environment. Creating this dashboard was a collaborative effort between A2SI, the City of Austin Office of Sustainability, Dell Medical School, and the Capital Area Region of Governments.

Our long-range goal is to identify areas of the 10-county region that suffer from poor air quality and mitigate their effects. However, the effect air quality has on a population is complex. Vulnerable populations often experience the worst health outcomes, and other environmental hazards such as heat exposure and a lack of tree cover can further exasperate air-quality induced afflictions. 

The dashboard attempts to visualize as many relevant variables as possible to understand the phenomenon of poor air-quality. In order to make it more digestible, the variables are broken up into four main sections: air quality, environment, health, and social vulnerability.
